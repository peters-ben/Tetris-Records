# Vault
Vault is an Android app for adding, storing, and viewing scores you have achieved on the popular video game Tetris. This
app was primarily made with the intent to keep track of scores from the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
version of Tetris, due to scores not being saved persistantly on the console, however it can be used for any
and all versions of Tetris.
